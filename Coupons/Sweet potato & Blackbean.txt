How to Make the Best Sweet Potato & Black Bean Chili
This vegetarian sweet potato chili is a breeze to make. Make it once, and you'll come back to it again and again. Check out our tips for the perfect sweet potato chili and ways you can make it your own.

To Peel or Not to Peel?
To peel or not to peel your sweet potatoes comes down to personal preference. We peel the sweet potatoes in this recipe which helps the potatoes break down some and thicken the chili. However, leaving the peels on the sweet potato ups the fiber content of the dish and also helps the cubes hold together in the chili if you prefer more texture. It's up to you! If you do leave the peels on, make sure the sweet potatoes are scrubbed before chopping.

Spice It Up
We love the smoky heat ground chipotle lends to this chili. Chipotle peppers are smoked jalape√±o peppers found in jars in a thick adobo sauce or dried and ground into powder. Ground chipotle chile pepper can be found in the spice section of most supermarkets or online. If you can't find dried chipotle, you can substitute it with the jarred variety, adding 1 chopped chipotle in adobo in place of the ground. Chipotle peppers can be on the spicy side, so if you prefer a more mild chili, you can substitute regular chili powder for the chipotle or skip it altogether.

Garnishes to Try
This chili is great served with tortilla chips, cornbread and coleslaw or topped with a few garnishes. Monterrey Jack or Cheddar cheese would be excellent melted on top along with sliced radish, scallion or finely chopped sweet onion. Avocado adds creaminess along with sour cream if you want something to tame the heat, or you can try adding a fresh chopped tomato or roasted corn to have even more veggies in this healthy chili.
